# **Etch-A-Sketch**

Remember the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy? Now you can try it out as a digital version!

## **Implementation**

- [x] **Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript.**
    - Set up a container div in the HTML file, and create the cell divs in JS.
    - Use Flexbox to makes the divs appear as a grid.

- [x] **Set up a hover effect so grid divs change color when mouse moves over them.**
    - Set up event listener as starting point.
    - Implement function to pick random colors as mouse moves.
    
- [x] **Add button to allow user to change grid size.**
    - Prompt user for new grid size, clear old grid and create a new grid.
    - Note grid size limit is between 2 and 100.

### **Highlights**

- I enjoyed this project a lot. I had a few difficulties, such as figuring out how to get the square cells to appear as a grid with Flexbox and how to clear the old grid before creating the new grid with the size inputted by user. I used what I learned so far in JavaScript and DOM manipulation, as well as some HTML/CSS. I am satisfied with how it turned out, but I might come back to it in the future to add more features.

### **Possible features to add:**

- [ ] Implement a button for single color of user's choice
- [ ] Opacity slider
- [ ] Change classic mouse cursor to a paintbrush
- [ ] Eraser button
- [ ] Export/Save sketch option
